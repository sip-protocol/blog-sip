We're excited to launch the official SIP Protocol blog - your new home for everything privacy in Web3.

## What is SIP Protocol?

**SIP (Shielded Intents Protocol)** is the privacy standard for Web3. Think of it like HTTPS for the internet - one toggle to shield your transactions with:

- **Stealth Addresses**: One-time recipient addresses that prevent transaction linkability
- **Pedersen Commitments**: Hide transaction amounts while enabling verification
- **Viewing Keys**: Selective disclosure for compliance without sacrificing privacy

We're building privacy middleware that sits between applications and blockchains, making any transaction private - regardless of which chain you're using.

## What You'll Find Here

### Technical Deep-Dives

Explore the cryptographic foundations of SIP Protocol. From EIP-5564 stealth addresses to homomorphic Pedersen commitments, we break down complex privacy tech into understandable pieces.

### Tutorials & Guides

Step-by-step guides for integrating SIP into your applications. Whether you're a wallet developer, DEX builder, or building the next privacy-first dApp, we've got you covered.

### Ecosystem Updates

Stay informed about partnerships, integrations, and milestones. SIP Protocol is chain-agnostic and settlement-agnostic - watch as we expand across Solana, Ethereum, NEAR, and beyond.

### Thought Leadership

Our perspective on where privacy in Web3 is heading. Why viewing keys matter for institutional adoption. How we're different from Tornado Cash clones. The path to making privacy the default.

## Why a Blog?

Documentation tells you *how*. The blog tells you *why*.

We believe privacy is a fundamental right, not a premium feature. This blog is where we share that philosophy, educate the community, and build in public.

## What's Coming

In the weeks ahead, expect posts on:

- **SIP vs PrivacyCash**: Why cryptographic privacy beats pool mixing
- **Quantum-Resistant Privacy**: Our Winternitz Vault integration
- **Solana Same-Chain Privacy**: Building native privacy for SOL
- **Viewing Keys Deep-Dive**: Compliance without compromise
